# 🧠 Sports-Akinator

## Overview

**Sports Akinator** is a console-based interactive guessing game built using C++. It asks the user a series of questions and tries to guess the sports player (either a footballer or cricketer) they are thinking of. The game is inspired by the classic Akinator format and demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular class structure built on core OOP concepts.
- **Two Akinators**: Cricket and Football player guessers implemented independently.
- **Predefined Player Database**: Contains profiles of 40 real-world athletes.
- **Interactive CLI Gameplay**: Users respond to intuitive yes/no questions via keyboard.
- **Encapsulation & Inheritance**: Used to manage player attributes and extend functionality.
- **Retry Loop & Replay Option**: Allows users to play again or exit seamlessly.

## Demonstrated Skills

- **C++ Programming**: Entire project written in C++ with standard libraries.
- **OOP Mastery**: Features encapsulation, class inheritance, and method overriding.
- **Algorithmic Logic**: Implements response-matching logic to narrow down player identity.
- **CLI UX**: Creative use of formatted output, color codes, and animations for engagement.
